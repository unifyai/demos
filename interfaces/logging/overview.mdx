Logging and observability are essential when you have an app in production, with
live traffic. There are lots of things that can go wrong with your LLM application.
Every application is different, which is why we've made it super easy to build your
own custom interface for logging (and interactively probing): function traces, usage
trends across time, common failure modes, and anything else you can think of! ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“Š
