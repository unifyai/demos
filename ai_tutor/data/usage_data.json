However, here the student claims 0.827 is correct and provides no clear reason it must be wrong, so this does not meet any of the criteria for awarding marks. Therefore M0 A0 (or B0) is given, resulting in 0 marks for part (a)."

Here, the student insists the incorrect answer is actually correct and does not provide any valid reasoning to show it is wrong. Since they fail to explain why 5/7 must be incorrect, no mark is gained for part (b). So M0 A0 (or B0) yields 0 marks."
